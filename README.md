## Solution Components
* Cisco Webex Room kit
* Honeywell fire alarm
* Cisco IR1101 router
* Informacast Single wire
* Node.js


## Business Needs and Challenges
- 	Employees in a company do not have proper instructions and efficient coordination during fire emergencies.
- 	The challenge is to create a simpler and automatic way to warn and coordinate tenants in case of a fire emergency.

## Solution

- This demo utilizes Honeywell fire alarm, IR1101 Router, Room Kit, Cisco Vision and Singlewire to create a smart fire safety system which will be used to help tenants evacuate.

## Business Outcomes

- Being more efficient in time to evacuate tenants in case of fire emergency.
- Automation of a process to track safety of tenants in case of fire emergency.

## Customer/Opportunity:
- Customer needs to increase efficiency of tenant evacuation in case of a fire. The fire safety team doesnâ€™t get up to date information about evacuated tenants.

## PoV description:
- Shutdown of all Webex meeting in the building via fire occasion and sends the notification to all tenants in the building via sms, emails and Webex Teams.
-	Then, using Cisco vision displaying evacuation map.
-	The Webex chat bot gets the reply from person when he is evacuated and fire safety team gets up-to-date information about people who left the building.

## Architecture
![4](./IMAGES/2.png)
-	The fire alarm is relayed through the IR1101 router to the server using a Trap event.
-	The code triggers a series of actions which includes stopping ongoing meetings in conference rooms and alerting the occupants, inform all the tenants using Singlewire through SMS and email.

## Launching the PoV:
-	The application is based on NodeJS.
-	Download the code and install all dependencies.
```
git clone <repo>
npm install
```
-	Ensure there is a Webex sandbox available with the room kit under registered in it.
-	Get a Singlewire account. Create a distribution list. Create a message template.
-	Record the message template ID and the distribution list ID.
- Fill the .env files
  1. ROOM_KIT_CONN: "JSXAPI" if the room kit is added as a personal device and you have SSH connection to the room kit; Otherwise, "RESTAPI" for shared device
  2. ROOM_KIT_IP, ROOM_KIT_USERNAME, ROOM_KIT_PASSWORD: only needed when ROOM_KIT_CONN is "JSXAPI"
  3. ACCESS_TOKEN: your Webex access token
  4. SINGLEWIRE_ACCESSTOKEN, SINGLEWIRE_DISTRIBUTION_ID, SINGLEWIRE_MESSAGE_TEMPLATE_ID: you may find it on [Singlewire API Explorer](https://api.icmobile.singlewire.com/api/docs)
-	Run the demo
```
npm start
```
-	And you should see the following screens if everything runs successfully.
